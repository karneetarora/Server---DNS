**2. Are there any known issues or functions that are not working?**
The project works perfectly on our local machine, but when trying to run it on the iLab machines, we get an error saying
no such file or directory found. Tried multiple things like changing file directory, changing path, etc., to no avail.

**3. What problems did you face developing code for this project?**
No real problems, but we had to learn how to get one client connected to two servers. Data structure also took some time
to figure out. Additionally, we're both relatively new to Python.

**4. Around how long did you spend on this project?**
10 hours
